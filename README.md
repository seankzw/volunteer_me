## NYP Year 3 Project
Mobile App Development.

# What is it for ?

Objective of the app: 
- To ease everyone to get the up-to-date community events happening around Singapore.
- Allow users to post in the forum, whenever they need help in their life.
  - For example : Son is in need of a blood donor. 

This project is built for one of the module in college called Mobile App Development.

# How I got the idea :

I got this idea of the app after we received the app requirement for the project. I was scrolling on Facebook and saw a mother in need of a Kidney donor as her child was in critical, life treatening condition. 

From then, I thought, why not have a app, where we don't merge with all the random posts in our news feed? That'll make people that are interested in engaging and helping the society to have a better focus on this field.

This project was done back in year 2019.
